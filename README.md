# CIS1702-Group-28

This is the API Data Analyser group project group completed by Omar, Muhammad, and Daniels

For our project's features, we can implement things such as: User input for queries, data extraction, data analysis, generation of reports for our chosen API.

We intend to do this by implementing requests in our Python program so we can fetch requests from public APIs and convert the payload of data into our Python dictionary, then format all the important information into a report that the user can access for a rundown of all the data we extract.

Omar and Muhammad have created early stage plans for this project, including pseudocode and flowhcarts that express the path that we want this program to take, and the features that it will end up having, this helped to visualise our goals and set them in place.
